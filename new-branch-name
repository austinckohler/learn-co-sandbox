git branch new-branch-name
This will create a local branch called new-branch-name. If we type git branch, we will see all the branches.
$ git branch
* master
  new-branch-name
  
  We need to get "on" new-branch-name. To do this we "check out" the new branch like so: 
  git checkout new-branch-name
  
  git branch - confirms "movement" into new branch new-branch-name
  master
* new-branch-name

If we want to create a new branch and move onto that branch in a single command, we can use:
git checkout -b new-branch-name

git checkout - : shortcut to switch back to previous branch
